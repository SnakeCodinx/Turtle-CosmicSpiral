# Cosmic Spiral

This code uses the Python Turtle library to create a stunning, colorful spiral pattern that appears to swirl and twirl like a cosmic whirlpool. The pattern is formed by drawing a series of connected lines with increasing lengths, with each line being drawn in a different color from the colors list. The hideturtle() function is used to hide the turtle, making the pattern more visually appealing.
